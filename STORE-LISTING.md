## Store Listing

### Name

Refeed - X Bookmarks in Your Feed

### Category

Tools

### Language

English (United States)

### Summary

Bring your saved X bookmarks back into your timeline, so the posts you meant to revisit actually resurface.

### Detailed Description

Refeed brings your saved X bookmarks back into your Home timeline.

You bookmark posts on X because you want to come back to them. Refeed puts those saved posts back into the place you already scroll: your feed. Run Collect from the popup, choose how often saved posts should appear, and Refeed mixes them between normal posts as you scroll.

What it does:
- Collects your X bookmarks into a private library on your device.
- Shows saved posts back in your Home timeline every few posts.
- Tags resurfaced posts so you know why they appeared.
- Lets you control spacing, collection depth, and appearance.
- Can also include liked posts if you choose, but bookmarks are the main focus.

Privacy:
- Everything stays on your device.
- No account, no server, no analytics, no tracking.
- Read-only: Refeed never likes, follows, posts, replies, reposts, bookmarks, unbookmarks, or messages on your behalf.
- Refeed never stores your X login.

## Privacy Practices

### Single Purpose

Refeed brings the user's own saved X bookmarks back into their Home timeline and keeps a private, on-device archive of those saved posts. 

### Permission Justifications

#### storage
Stores user settings and the local index of collected posts in the browser's own storage on the user's device.

#### unlimitedStorage
Allows the local archive to hold a full personal history of saved X bookmarks, which may contain thousands of posts.

#### scripting
Attaches Refeed's content script to an x.com tab that was already open when the extension was enabled, so the extension works without forcing a disruptive reload.

#### webRequest
Reads, on a read-only basis, the shape of the x.com GraphQL requests the browser already makes for Bookmarks and Likes. Refeed uses that request shape to collect the user's own saved posts when the user clicks Collect. It never blocks, modifies, redirects, or transmits requests.

#### Host permission
Refeed runs only on X. It needs access to x.com / twitter.com to read the user's own bookmarks and weave saved posts back into the Home timeline.

### Remote Code

Select: No, I am not using remote code.

### Data Usage

Check exactly one data category:

- Website content

Leave every other data category unchecked.

Tick all three certification checkboxes:

- I do not sell or transfer user data to third parties.
- I do not use or transfer user data for purposes unrelated to my item's single purpose.
- I do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending.

## Access / Test Instructions

Refeed only acts on x.com while the reviewer is logged into an X account. To test it:

1. Enable the extension; it appears in the toolbar as Refeed.
2. Go to https://x.com and log in to an X account that already has some bookmarked posts. 
3. Open the Bookmarks page once. If testing likes too, open the profile's Likes tab once. This lets Refeed observe, read-only, the request it later replays. Nothing is uploaded.
4. Click the Refeed toolbar icon and press Collect everything. The Collected / Liked / Saved counts climb as it gathers saved posts into local storage.
5. Go to the Home timeline and scroll. Every few posts, one of the user's saved posts is woven in and tagged with why it appeared.
6. If nothing appears after Collect, hard-refresh the Home tab with Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R and scroll again.

All data stays in the browser's local storage on the device. The only network requests Refeed makes go to X's own API, using the user's existing session.
